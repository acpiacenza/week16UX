    <li>I am pretty fearless, and you know why? Because I don't handle fear very well; I'm not a good terrified person.
    </li>
    <li>If you have stage fright, it never goes away. But then I wonder: is the key to that magical performance because of the fear?
    </li>
    <li>Do you want to be an artist and a writer, or a wife and a lover? With kids, your focus changes. I don't want to go to PTA meetings.</li>
